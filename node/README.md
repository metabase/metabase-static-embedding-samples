# Metabase Node.js static embedding sample

This sample code demonstrates using Metabase static embedding in Node.js using Express.

# Running this sample

## Pre-requisites
* Have a running instance of Metabase. If you don't have one
  * [download the free open source version](https://www.metabase.com/start/oss/) or
  * [sign up for a free trial of Metabase Cloud](https://www.metabase.com/pricing/).
* A dashboard to embed. If you don't have one, use X-Rays to let Metabase create one for you. Note down the dashboard id.

## Preparing the embed

2. Go to admin settings and enabling embedding.
3. Under admin settings/embedding, click on static embedding and copy the embedding secret key.

## Configure the app

2. Create an env var pointing to your Metabase site URL, if it's not on http://localhost:3000 `$ export METABASE_SITE_URL="http://localhost:4000"`
3. Create an env var with the ID of the dashboard to embed: `$ export METABASE_EMBED_DASHBOARD_ID="8"`
3. Install dependencies: `$ bundle install`

## Embed the dashboard
1. Go to your dashboard, click on the share/embed button at the top
2. Click on the "Publish" button
3. Install the dependencies: `$ npm install`
4. Start the server: `$ node index.js`
5. Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:8080
